# LeetCode-SQL
I have been practising few SQL  coding questions to upscale my abilities.

# Question One: Combine Two Tables
Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
FirstName, LastName, City, State

# Question Three: Nth Highest Salary
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

# Question Four: Rank Scores
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
