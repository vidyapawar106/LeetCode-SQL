# LeetCode-SQL
We all know how crucial is Data Engineering in Data Science. Therefore, I have been practising few SQL coding questions on LeetCode to enhance my data manipulation skills. You can find all the solutions to these questions in Solutions.sql file.
Note: All the solutions have been written in MySQL
